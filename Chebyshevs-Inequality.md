# Chebyshev’s Inequality

- **Definition of Chebyshev’s Inequality**: 
  - For any distribution with finite variance, the proportion(*portion*) *of the observations* within k standard deviations of the arithmetic mean *is at least* 1 − 1/k^2 for all k > 1.
  - The most frequently cited facts that result from Chebyshev’s inequality are that a two-standard-deviation interval around the mean must contain at least 75 percent of the observations
  - Three-standard-deviation interval around the mean must contain at least 89 percent of the observations, no matter how the data are distributed
