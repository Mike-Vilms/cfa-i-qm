Properties of Correlation.
- Correlation is a number between −1 and +1 for two random variables
- A correlation of 0 (uncorrelated variables) indicates an absence of any linear (straight-line) relationship between the variables. 
  - Increasingly positive correlation indicates an increasingly strong positive linear relationship (up to 1, which indicates a perfect linear relationship). 
  - Increasingly negative correlation indicates an increasingly strong negative (inverse) linear relationship (down to −1, which indicates a perfect inverse linear relationship).
