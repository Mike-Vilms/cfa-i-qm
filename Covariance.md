- The covariance terms capture how the co-movements of returns affect portfolio variance.
  - For example, consider two stocks: One tends to have high returns (relative to its expected return) when the other has low returns (relative to its expected return). 
  - The returns on one stock tend to offset the returns on the other stock, lowering the variability or variance of returns on the portfolio. 
- From the definition of covariance, we can establish two essential observations about covariance:
  - We can interpret the sign of covariance as follows:
    - Covariance of returns is negative if, when the return on one asset is above its expected value, the return on the other asset tends to be below its expected value (an average inverse relationship between returns).
    - Covariance of returns is 0 if returns on the assets are unrelated.
    - Covariance of returns is positive when the returns on both assets tend to be on the same side (above or below) their expected values at the same time (an average positive relationship between returns).
- The covariance of a random variable with itself (own covariance) is its own variance
