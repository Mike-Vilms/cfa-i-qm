# Internal Rate of Return
- The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of a project zero
  - In other words, it is the expected compound annual rate of return that will be earned on a project or investment
  - The rate is “internal” because it depends only on the cash flows of the investment; no external data are needed
  - In the study of bonds, we encounter IRR under the name of **yield to maturity**
  - Before we continue, however, we must add a note of caution about interpreting IRR: Even if our cash flow projections are correct, we will realize a compound rate of return that is equal to IRR over the life of the investment **only if** we can reinvest all interim cash flows at exactly the IRR
