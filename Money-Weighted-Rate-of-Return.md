# Money-Weighted Rate of Return

- The money-weighted rate of return (MWRR) is a measure of the performance of an investment
- The MWRR is calculated by finding the rate of return that will set the present values (PV) of all cash flows equal to the value of the initial investment.

#### Limitations of Using Money-Weighted Rate of Return
- The MWRR considers all the cash flows from the fund or contribution, including withdrawals
- The MWRR is calculated by finding the rate of return that will set the **present values of all cash flows equal to the value of the initial investment**.
- Should an investment extend over several quarters, for example, the **MWRR lends more weight to the performance of the fund when it is at its largest—hence**, the description “**money-weighted**”
