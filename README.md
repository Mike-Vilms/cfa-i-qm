# Quantitative Methods

- **"Time Value of Money" Concept**
- **"Stated Annual Interest Rate" ("Quoted Interest Rate") vs a "Periodic Rate"**
  - The periodic rate is the quoted interest rate per period; it equals the stated annual interest rate divided by the number of compounding periods per year
- **Feature Value of Single Cash Flow**

- **Feature Value of Series of Cash Flows**

  - The harmonic mean may be viewed as a special type of weighted mean in which an 
observation’s weight is inversely proportional to its magnitude

- Dispersion is the variability around the central tendency
- Most common measures of dispersion: 
  - range, 
  - mean absolute deviation, 
  - variance, and 
  - standard deviation. 
- These are all measures of absolute dispersion. Absolute dispersion is the amount of variability present without comparison to any reference point or benchmark
- **Range** = Maximum value – Minimum value
- **The Mean Absolute Deviation**:
