# Quantitative Methods

- **"Time Value of Money" Concept**
- **"Stated Annual Interest Rate" ("Quoted Interest Rate") vs a "Periodic Rate"**
  - The periodic rate is the quoted interest rate per period; it equals the stated annual interest rate divided by the number of compounding periods per year
- **Feature Value of Single Cash Flow**
