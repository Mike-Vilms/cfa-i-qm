- Sharpe ratio measures the reward, in terms of mean excess return, per unit of risk, as measured by standard deviation of return
- Those risk-averse investors who make decisions only in terms of mean return and standard deviation of return prefer portfolios with larger Sharpe ratios to those with smaller Sharpe ratios
- **The conceptual limitation of the Sharpe ratio is that it considers only one aspect of risk, standard deviation of return**
  - Standard deviation is most appropriate as a risk measure for portfolio strategies with approximately symmetric return distributions
  - Strategies with option elements have asymmetric returns. Relatedly, an investment strategy may produce frequent small gains but have the potential for infrequent but extremely large losses
  - Calculated over a period in which the strategy is working (a large loss has not occurred), this type of strategy would have a high Sharpe ratio
  - In this case, the Sharpe ratio would give an overly optimistic picture of risk-adjusted performance because standard deviation would incompletely measure the risk assumed
